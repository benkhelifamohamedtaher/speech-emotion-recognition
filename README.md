Welcome to the **Speech Emotion Recognition** repository! This project aims to develop a deep learning system that recognizes emotions from speech. Using advanced transformer architecture, the system achieves an accuracy of 50.5% in classifying emotions into eight distinct categories. This repository includes code, models, and datasets for both training and real-time analysis.

## üöÄ Overview

Emotion recognition from speech is a crucial task in various applications, such as virtual assistants, mental health monitoring, and customer service. This project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze audio signals and classify emotions effectively.

### Key Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art transformer models.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Capable of processing audio streams in real time.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Classifies emotions into eight categories.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for anyone to use and contribute.

## üì¶ Getting Started

To get started with the Speech Emotion Recognition project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benkhelifamohamedtaher/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd speech-emotion-recognition
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Dataset**:
   You can download the RAVDESS dataset from [this link](https://github.com/benkhelifamohamedtaher/speech-emotion-recognition/releases). Follow the instructions to extract and place the dataset in the appropriate folder.

5. **Run the Model**:
   Execute the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

6. **Real-Time Emotion Recognition**:
   To test the real-time analysis, run:
   ```bash
   python real_time_analysis.py
   ```

## üìä Model Architecture

The core of this project is built on transformer architecture, which allows for better handling of sequential data. The model consists of the following components:

- **Input Layer**: Takes audio features as input.
- **Transformer Layers**: Comprises multiple layers of attention mechanisms.
- **Output Layer**: Classifies the input into one of the eight emotion categories.

### Training Process

The model is trained using the RAVDESS dataset, which contains recordings of actors expressing different emotions. The training process involves:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing audio signals and extracting features.
- **Training**: Using cross-entropy loss and an optimizer like Adam.
- **Validation**: Evaluating model performance on a separate validation set.

## üé§ Emotions Classification

The model classifies speech into the following eight emotions:

1. **Anger**
2. **Disgust**
3. **Fear**
4. **Happiness**
5. **Sadness**
6. **Surprise**
7. **Neutral**
8. **Calm**

Each emotion has unique characteristics in speech patterns, which the model learns to identify.

## üìà Performance Metrics

The model achieves a classification accuracy of 50.5% on the test set. The performance metrics include:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: Ratio of true positive predictions to total positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Ratio of true positive predictions to actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **PyTorch**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **TensorFlow**: Used for certain model evaluations and comparisons.
- **Librosa**: For audio processing and feature extraction.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress and results.
