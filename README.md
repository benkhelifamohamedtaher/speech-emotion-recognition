## 📊 Dataset Processing

This project uses the [RAVDESS dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976) (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song). Follow these steps precisely:

1. **Download the Dataset Files**:
   ```bash
   # Create dataset directory
   mkdir -p dataset_raw
   cd dataset_raw
   ```
   
   **Option A: Download Everything at Once (Recommended)**
   - Visit the [RAVDESS dataset page on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976)
   - Click the "Download all" button in the top right corner
   - Save the downloaded file (1188976.zip, approximately 25.6 GB)
   - Extract the zip file:
     ```bash
     unzip 1188976.zip
     ```
   
   **Option B: Download Individual Files**
   - If you only need the audio speech data:
     ```bash
     # Download only the Audio Speech file (208.5 MB)
     wget https://zenodo.org/record/1188976/files/Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24.zip
     unzip Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24.zip
     ```

2. **Verify Dataset Structure**:
   The extracted dataset should have the following structure:
   ```
   dataset_raw/
   └── Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24/
       ├── Actor_01/
       │   ├── 03-01-01-01-01-01-01.wav
       │   ├── 03-01-01-01-01-02-01.wav
       │   └── ... (more audio files)
       ├── Actor_02/
       │   ├── 03-01-01-01-01-01-02.wav
       │   └── ... (more audio files)
       └── ... (Actor_03 through Actor_24 folders)
   ```

3. **Process the Dataset for Training**:
   ```bash
   # Return to project root first if needed
   cd ..
   
   # Run the dataset preparation script
   python src/prepare_ravdess.py \
     --dataset_path dataset_raw/Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24 \
     --output_path processed_dataset \
     --train_ratio 0.7 \
     --val_ratio 0.15 \
     --test_ratio 0.15
   ```

4. **Verify Processed Dataset**:
   ```bash
   # Check processed dataset structure
   ls -la processed_dataset
   
   # You should see train, val, and test directories with organized audio files
   # Each file will be labeled with its emotion category
   ```

### Dataset File Naming Convention

RAVDESS audio files follow this naming convention:

`03-01-04-01-02-01-12.wav` means:
- Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only)
- Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song)
- Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised)
- Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong)
- Statement (01 = "Kids are talking by the door", 02 = "Dogs are sitting by the door")
- Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition)
- Actor (01 to 24. Odd-numbered actors are male, even-numbered actors are female)

My processing script handles this naming convention automatically to extract emotions and organize files.

> **IMPORTANT**: The raw dataset (~25.6GB) and processed audio files are deliberately excluded from this repository due to their size. You must follow the steps above to prepare the dataset locally.

## 💾 Model Files

Pre-trained models are not included in this repository due to their large size. After training your own models using the instructions below, they will be saved in the `models/` directory.

To use a specific model for inference:

```bash
# Run inference with your trained model
python src/inference.py --model_path models/ravdess_simple/best_model.pt
```

### Key Technical Innovations

- **Transformer-based Audio Processing**: Applied transformer architecture to capture long-range dependencies in speech signals
- **Robust Feature Extraction**: Developed a pipeline combining MFCCs, mel spectrograms, and temporal features
- **Error-Resilient Training**: Implemented comprehensive error handling to ensure stability during long training runs
- **Attention Visualization**: Created tools to visualize which parts of speech the model focuses on for different emotions
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized inference for low-latency emotion recognition in streaming audio

### Error Analysis

Analyzing the confusion matrix revealed:
- "Happy" and "Surprised" emotions are the most challenging to distinguish
- "Neutral" and "Calm" emotions have significant overlap (expected due to similarity)
- "Angry" and "Fearful" emotions are more accurately classified than others
- "Disgust" was the most difficult emotion to detect correctly

These insights informed targeted improvements in the model architecture.

## 📈 Model Development Journey

This project showcases my iterative approach to deep learning model development:

If you encounter problems installing PyAudio:

- **macOS**: `brew install portaudio && pip install pyaudio`
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio`
- **Windows**: `pip install pipwin && pipwin install pyaudio`

### CUDA/GPU Issues

If you're experiencing issues with GPU acceleration:

1. Verify CUDA is available: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
2. For CPU-only training, add the `--device cpu` flag to training scripts
3. Reduce batch size if running into memory issues: `--batch_size 8`

### Missing Files or Directory Issues

If the project doesn't seem to find certain files or directories:

1. Make sure you've run the dataset preparation script first
2. Check that all paths are correctly set relative to the project root
3. Use `src/check_project.py` to verify the project structure
