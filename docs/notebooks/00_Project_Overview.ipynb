        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project documents the development of a deep learning system for recognizing emotions in human speech. Through iterative model development and architecture optimization, I achieved **50.5% accuracy** on an 8-class emotion recognition task using the RAVDESS dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "This accuracy represents a significant achievement considering:\n",
        "- Random chance would be 12.5% for 8 classes\n",
        "- Commercial systems often focus on just 3-4 emotion classes\n",
        "- The nuanced differences between certain emotion pairs (e.g., neutral/calm)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Goals\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Develop a system capable of recognizing 8 distinct emotions from speech audio\n",
        "2. Explore different neural network architectures for audio processing\n",
